const a = "Hello";
//const,var, and let are keywords in Javascript. 
//Line 1 declares a variable called "a" and initialises
// it with a string called "Hello"
//Tells the computer to go into the memory and 
//reserve a space(variable) name that space "a" 
//and insert a value "Hello" that will not change 
//over time as in, it is constant
//When declaring a constant, you must give it a value
var b;
//Line also identifies a space/memory space with a variable that isnt limited
//called "b" but has no value in this instance
let c;
// Line 12 is the same as line 2 but the scope of this variable
// will be limited

//We have seen three different ways in which to tell 
//a computer to reserve space/memory using the Javascript Languauge

b = "World";
c = "It's me, Kesa again";
//In the above lines, we are assigning values to the 
// variables/spaces/memories created in the instances before this.

//The process of creating a variable is called declaring
//The process of assigning a value to a variable is called initialisng 
//The difference btn const,var,let is in their scope

console.log(a+"\t"+b +"\n"+c);

//Line 28 tells the computer to output something 
//on the screen/monitor
//The + operator puts things together, it concantenates stuff.
//the \t operator is a special character that includes 
//space between characters/stuff/value being concatenated. 
// \n takes you to a new line.
